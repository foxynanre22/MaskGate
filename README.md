# Motivation
The aim of the project is to create a model of a neural network to recognize people who have protective masks on their faces. It is very useful because nowadays the epidemiological situation is worsening almost all over the world. The project presents functionality that helps to control people regarding their compliance with sanitary and epidemiological standards.

# Technologies used
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

# Features
This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.
